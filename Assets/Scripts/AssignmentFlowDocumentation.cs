/*
=== ASSIGNMENT NAVIGATION FLOW FIX SUMMARY ===

PROBLEM:
When students click on subjects (Science, Math, etc.), they see the default 
"QUIZ 1: PLANTS" interface instead of the teacher's actual assignment.

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:

1. MODIFIED DynamicStagePanel.cs:
   - Added CheckForTeacherAssignment() method to check for active teacher assignments
   - Added LoadTeacherAssignment() method to load teacher assignments directly
   - Modified ShowStages() method to check for teacher assignments first before showing default stages

2. CREATED AssignmentManager.cs:
   - Singleton pattern for managing teacher assignments across scenes
   - SetTeacherAssignment() method to store teacher assignments
   - CheckForActiveAssignments() method to fetch assignments from server
   - Integration with Flask backend for assignment synchronization

3. UPDATED gamemechanicdragbuttons.cs:
   - Added LoadAssignmentInfo() method to load assignment data from PlayerPrefs
   - Modified InitializeGame() to check for teacher assignments on startup
   - Support for both teacher assignments and default assignments

4. CREATED TeacherAssignmentTester.cs:
   - Test script to simulate teacher assignment creation
   - Debug methods to set/clear assignments for testing
   - Hotkeys for quick testing (T=set, C=clear, L=log status)

HOW IT WORKS NOW:

Teacher Side (Simulated):
1. Teacher creates assignment using AssignmentManager.SetTeacherAssignment()
2. Assignment data is stored in PlayerPrefs and sent to Flask server
3. Assignment includes: subject, ID, title, content

Student Side:
1. Student clicks on subject button (e.g., Science)
2. DynamicStagePanel.ShowStages() is called
3. CheckForTeacherAssignment() checks if there's an active assignment for that subject
4. If teacher assignment exists:
   - LoadTeacherAssignment() stores assignment info in PlayerPrefs
   - Scene loads directly to GameplayScene with teacher assignment
5. If no teacher assignment:
   - Shows default stage panel with Stage 1, 2, 3 buttons

Gameplay Scene:
1. gamemechanicdragbuttons.cs LoadAssignmentInfo() runs on Start()
2. Checks AssignmentSource in PlayerPrefs
3. If "teacher", loads teacher assignment data and updates UI
4. If "default", uses default assignment ID

TESTING THE FIX:

1. Add TeacherAssignmentTester script to a GameObject in your main menu
2. Press 'T' key or call SetTestAssignment() to create a test assignment for Science
3. Click on Science subject button
4. Should now load directly to assignment instead of showing stage panel
5. Press 'C' key to clear assignment and test default behavior

PlayerPrefs KEYS USED:
- ActiveAssignmentSubject: Subject name (Science, Math, etc.)
- ActiveAssignmentId: Unique assignment identifier
- ActiveAssignmentTitle: Assignment title shown to students
- ActiveAssignmentContent: Assignment description/content
- AssignmentSource: "teacher" or "default"
- CurrentAssignmentId: Assignment ID for current gameplay session
- CurrentSubject: Subject for current gameplay session
- CurrentAssignmentTitle: Title for current gameplay session

FLASK INTEGRATION:
- POST /api/teacher_assignment: Send assignment creation
- GET /api/get_active_assignments: Fetch active assignments for student
- All assignment tracking and submission includes assignment_id

This fix ensures that when teachers create assignments, students clicking on 
subjects will go directly to the teacher's assignment instead of the default quiz interface.
